# 🛒 Ecommerce API

A modern, robust, and fully-featured E-commerce backend API built with **FastAPI**, demonstrating production-ready patterns and practices. This project was built as a learning journey into advanced backend development, focusing on structure, testing, and scalability.

## 🚀 Features

- **🔐 JWT Authentication & Authorization:** Secure user login/admin routes with OAuth2 password flow.
- **🗃️ SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM:** Modern, asynchronous-friendly ORM with full type annotation support.
- **✅ Comprehensive Testing:** Unit and integration tests with `pytest`, including parameterized testing for various input scenarios.
- **⚡ Redis Caching:** Advanced caching layer for product listings and details to enhance performance.
- **🐳 Dockerized Development:** Complete containerization with Docker and Docker Compose for seamless setup.
- **📦 Dependency Injection:** Clean and manageable code with FastAPI's powerful dependency injection system.
- **🛡️ Defensive Programming:** Extensive input validation with Pydantic and error handling.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
- **Database:** [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- **ORM:** [SQLAlchemy 2.0](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
- **Cache:** [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- **Testing:** [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/)
- **Containerization:** [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- **Password Hashing:** [Passlib (bcrypt)](https://passlib.readthedocs.io/)

## 📦 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `POST` | `/register` | Create a new user account | No |
| `POST` | `/login` | Login and receive a JWT token | No |
| `GET` | `/products/` | Get a list of products (with query params) | No |
| `GET` | `/products/{id}` | Get a specific product's details | No |
| `POST` | `/products/` | Create a new product | Admin |
| `POST` | `/cart/add/` | Add a product to the user's cart | User |
| `GET` | `/cart/` | Get the contents of the user's cart | User |

## 🏃‍♂️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd ecommerce-api
    ```

2.  **Configure Environment (Optional):**
    Copy the example environment file and adjust the values if needed (especially the database password).
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Build and start the containers:**
    This command will build the Python image, start PostgreSQL, Redis, and the FastAPI server.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

4.  **Access the Application:**
    - **API Server:** http://localhost:8000
    - **Interactive API Docs (Swagger UI):** http://localhost:8000/docs
    - **Alternative API Docs (ReDoc):** http://localhost:8000/redoc

5.  **(Optional) Run Tests:**
    Execute the test suite to verify everything is working correctly.
    ```bash
    docker-compose exec web pytest -v
    ```

## 🧪 Testing

This project emphasizes test-driven development principles. The test suite includes:

- **Authentication Tests:** Verifying protected routes reject unauthenticated requests.
- **Parameterized Route Tests:** Efficiently testing multiple input scenarios (e.g., valid IDs, invalid strings, non-existent resources) for a single endpoint.

**Example Test Snippet:**
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("product_id, status_code", [(1, 200), (2, 200), ('hello', 422), (50, 404)])
def test_get_product(self, product_id, status_code):
    response = client.get(f'/products/{product_id}')
    assert response.status_code == status_code
```

Run the tests with:
```bash
docker-compose exec web pytest app/tests/ -v
```
